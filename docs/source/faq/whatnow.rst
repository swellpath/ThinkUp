I downloaded ThinkUp to my computer, but I don't know how to install it. What do I do now?
==========================================================================================

ThinkUp doesn't run on your desktop computer like a regular application. You'll need a web server to install and run it.
Typically users purchase a web hosting plan and install ThinkUp on it the same way they'd install WordPress.

:doc:`Here's how to install ThinkUp </install/index>`.

If you don't have access to a web server, you can `run ThinkUp for free on PHPFog
<http://expertlabs.org/2011/12/php-fog-adds-free-thinkup-hosting.html>`_ or try
our `ThinkUp Launcher for Amazon EC2 <http://expertlabs.aaas.org/thinkup-launcher/>`_. Alternately, power ThinkUp users
have documented how to install ThinkUp
on `Windows <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki/Installation:-Windows>`_ and
`Mac OS X <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki/Installation:-Mac-OS-X>`_ on the community wiki.
